	<h2> Captain America: Backstory and Other Information</h2>
	<p id="one"> Captain America, or Steve Rogers, was born on the first of July, in 1918. He first appeared in the Captain America Comics, starting in March of 1941. The character was created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. He has also made appearances in The Avengers, other comic series and more. Captain America was once a frail, fragile young man who was enhanced to peak human perfection through a serum known as Super Soldier serum. He aided in the Axis Powers' war efforts, but was frozen in ice late in the war and survived to present day, when he was revived. </p>

	<h2 id="three"> Captain America: Shield Almighty</h2>
	<p> Unarguably one of the most notable parts of Captain America is his signature shield, bearing red, white and blue stripes with one large,whiteish silver star in the center. This shield acts like a boomerang, it always comes back to Cap. The shield has been seen blocking bullets, knocking down bad guys and even being used as a boost to help colleagues and teammates of Captain get some air. The shield is impenetrable, and undefeatable. Undeniably the best companion to carry with you on the battlefield.</p>
